                1. Petition
            </h3>
                <p>
                    Although you may feel like one small signature on a website won't make a change, petitions are a great way to show the government and leaders our opinions on their decisions. Our voice matters and petitioning is a great way to use it.

                    2. Call The White House
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        This one might seem a little scary at first, but this can make just as big a difference as signing a petition. Using direct communication is an effective and efficient way to get your point across to authorative figures. Phone messages are quick to record and can be passed down directly to the president.
