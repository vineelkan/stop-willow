                The Willow Project is a $8 billion oil and drilling project proposed by the oil company ConocoPhillips in Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve. The project involves the construction of up to five drilling pads on the Alaskan North Slope, each with multiple wells to extract oil and gas resources. The project would be developed over the course of the next several years, estimating a total of 180,000 barrels of oil per day at peak production. Over the next 30 years, this amount will reach 590 million oil barrels. However, this idea, if implemented, would disrupt the environment, wildlife, and indigenous groups in proximity to the drilling areas.
